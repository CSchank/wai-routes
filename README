Wai Routes (wai-routes-0.3.0)
==============================

This package provides typesafe URLs for Wai applications.

Features:
  - Automatic generation of Route boilerplate using TH
  - Easy Nested Routes
  - Sitewide Master datatype which is passed to all handlers
    and can be used for persistent data (like DB connections)
  - RouteM monad that makes it easy to compose an application
    with multiple routes and middleware.
  - Handlers can abort processing and pass control to the next
    application in the wai stack

It depends on yesod-routes package for the TH functionality (but not the rest of yesod). The aim is to provide a similar level of typesafe URL functionality to Wai applications as is available to Yesod applications.


Example Usage
=============

The following builds a simple JSON service (using Aeson for JSON conversion)


    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, TypeFamilies #-}

    import Network.Wai
    import Network.Wai.Middleware.Routes

    import Data.IORef

    -- The Site Argument
    data MyRoute = MyRoute (IORef DB)

    -- Generate Routes
    mkRoute MyRoute [parseRoutes|
    /             UsersR         GET
    /user/#Int    UserR:
      /              UserRootR   GET
      /delete        UserDeleteR POST
    |]

    -- Define Handlers
    -- All Users Page
    getUsersR :: Handler MyRoute
    getUsersR (MyRoute dbref) request = ...
    -- Single User Page
    getUserRootR :: Int -> Handler MyRoute
    getUserRootR userid (MyRoute dbref) request = ...
    -- Delete Single User
    postUserDeleteR :: Int -> Handler MyRoute
    postUserDeleteR userid (MyRoute dbref) request = ...

    -- Define Application using RouteM Monad
    myApp = do
      db <- liftIO $ newIORef mydb
      route (MyRoute db)
      setDefaultAction $ staticApp $ defaultFileServerSettings "static"

    -- Run the application
    main :: IO ()
    main = toWaiApp myApp >>= run 8080
